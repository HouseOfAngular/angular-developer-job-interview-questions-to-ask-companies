# Angular Developer Job Interview: Questions from a Developer

At [House of Angular](https://houseofangular.io/), we provide hundreds of technical developer interviews every year. That's why we collected a list of questions ambitious Angular developers ask that companies should be ready to answer.

We will appreciate it if you let us know whether this list was helpful for you.

Just send your feedback to: [office@houseofangular.io](mailto:office@houseofangular.io)
